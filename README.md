### AnvilRepair

This plugin allows you to repair your items with an anvil.

### NOTICE
## Keep in mind that this plugin is for newer versions of Pocketmine. You will not be allowed to use it on older versions of Pocketmine.

## Also, warning: I do not own any of this plugin source. It was made by a user which I have took over the project due to their inactivity with this project. I do not steal people's projects for a laugh, or for a troll or anything. I also do not steal projects without reason. I usually take over a developer's job due to the plugin's inactivity, and the developer's inactivity with the project also. So do not open an issue saying "OMG! This isn't your project!" or "This project is going to be taken down due to their stealing of other developer's work." Just to clarify that I do not steal projects. I never have done, and I never will in the future. Usually, if they've been inactive for about a month, I will usually take action regarding their inactivitey or even the project's inactivity within 5 days later. If no one's developed, or even touched a plugin they developed for a year, I instantly take action, and will take over their project untill they are back. This is so other MCPE players who are server owners can enjoy their plugins as well as the inactive ones which have been brought back to life by The Fixer development team, also known as VMPE Development team. We've been doing this job for 1-2 months, and will continue doing so. But as always, I do not steal projects out of players, who have been very active with their Project. So please enjoy this plugin, and I will keep you all up dated, and will update the plugins when need to.
